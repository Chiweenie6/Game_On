## Description
An application created using MERN stack. The application has a React front end , an Express.js and Node.js server and a MongoDB database to hold the information. The application is built with GraphQL API along with an Apollo Server. GraphQL queries and mutations allow the user to view information on the games as well as leave reviews. The user can save games to their profile to view again without having to find them again.
